  # bluetooth commute tracking
  
I should start off by saying that I spend a borderline-obsessive amount of time tracking my commute to work each day. I find it fun to optimize my commute and try and figure out the fastest way to get around the city.

Often enough, I try to remember to time my commute but always end up forgetting to start or stop my timer.

After playing around with bluetooth low energy beacons, why can't I have them do all of the work for me? It would be awesome to have a iBeacon at my home and work which would tell my phone to stop and start a timer. My phone could then, in the background, send a ping to an external app that keeps track of all of these things for me! I can generate some cool data and, most importantly, make some pretty graphs.

_Now, to begin hacking_
