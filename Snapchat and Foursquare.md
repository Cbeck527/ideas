# snapchat and foursquare

Snapchat recently introduced [Our Story](http://blog.snapchat.com/post/89064817345/introducing-our-story) where fans at the Electric Daisy carnival could upload their snaps to a communal story. Those attending the festival could see the show from other points of view, and those who weren't there could follow along from anywhere.

Snapchat can link into Foursquare events and create a communal story for any 'official' gathering. From there, people who attended can view the story in real time or after the event has finished. Snapchat can recognize attendance with either a authorized Foursquare application, or pull in the geofence information from Foursquare.
